This is Emacs config file of Guangwei Weng 
@School of Statistics, University of Minnesota

As you can see, I hold a major in statistics. So this version of emacs
configuration files are mainly for building an emacs environment for
statisticians. Packages like AUCTEX, ESS, ELPY, which are frequently used by
statisticians, are included. 

To use my configuration, just go to your home directory and type the following
command
git clone "https://github.com/weng-gw/emacs.d.git"

And before that make sure you have already delete your own version of .emacs
and .emacs.d

If you have any questions, please contact email: wengx076@umn.edu
